# About
Welcome to our volunteer project, merging creativity and innovation to bring the Star Wars cinematic experience to Minecraft.
Our WorldEdit tracking plugin should help with that, by tracking interesting metrics to embrace competitive building rivalry.

# Instructions
You'll find a Maven project that should just work out of the box with your IDE of choice.
Just run the *package* task to export the .jar file. 

# Contribution Guidelines
We believe in fostering a collaborative and secure environment. To ensure smooth collaboration, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Comment your code, especially the information block for public methods. This helps everyone understand the code better.
- If you make significant changes to a class, be sure to add yourself to the author list.
- Use meaningful commit messages. Avoid vague examples like "Bug fix" or "Made it better." Let's keep things clear and informative.

### Let's make building fun and efficient! ðŸš€
